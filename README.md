# Face Detection Model
This project implements a face detection model using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The model detects faces in images and video streams, and it includes data collection, augmentation, model training, and real-time face detection using a webcam.

## Importing Libraries
Start by importing necessary libraries for the project.

## Collecting Data
Set the number of images and the path to store them. Capture images using a webcam.

## Setting up Camera
Connect to the camera and capture images. Store the images in the specified directory and display them in a window.

## Labelling
Use Labelme to annotate the captured images.

## Dataset Preparation
Load the images and labels, and prepare a function to load and preprocess images.

## Partitioning Data
Partition the data into training, validation, and test sets with a split of 70% for training, and 15% each for validation and test.

## Data Augmentation
Set up an augmentation pipeline using Albumentations to perform various image transformations like random cropping, horizontal flipping, brightness/contrast adjustment, gamma correction, RGB shift, and vertical flipping.

## Model Building and Training
Building the Model
Build a deep learning model using the VGG16 architecture as a base model for feature extraction, followed by custom layers for classification and bounding box regression.

## Compiling and Training the Model
Compile the model with appropriate loss functions and an optimizer. Train the model using the training dataset and validate it using the validation dataset. Use TensorBoard for logging and visualization.

## Real-Time Detection
Running the Model on a Webcam
Use the trained model to perform real-time face detection using a webcam. Capture video frames, preprocess them, and make predictions. Draw bounding boxes around detected faces and display the video stream.
